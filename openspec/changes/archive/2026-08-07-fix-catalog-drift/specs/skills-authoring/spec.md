## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Uniform frontmatter metadata

Every `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` SHALL carry: `name` (== directory), `description` (folded block scalar),
`metadata.author: solvelab`, `metadata.version` (semver), `metadata.category` from the controlled set
{backend, testing, fivem, game, devops, docs, git, process, nui, frontend, tooling}, `license: MIT`,
and `compatibility`.

The controlled set is the one the CI frontmatter check enforces. When the two disagree, the gate is
authoritative and this document is corrected, because a contributor who follows a document that is
behind its gate writes a change the build rejects.

#### Scenario: CI rejects incomplete frontmatter

- **WHEN** a skill is added or edited without `metadata.version`, `license`, or with a category outside
  the controlled set
- **THEN** the CI validate job fails with a file-specific error

#### Scenario: The documented set matches the enforced set

- **WHEN** a category is added to the CI frontmatter check
- **THEN** this requirement is updated in the same change, so no contributor reads a controlled set
  that is narrower than the one the build accepts
