## 1. Evidence & Sources (MANDATORY)

<!-- Always the FIRST group: probe before you write. Record the COMMAND and a fragment of its
     RAW OUTPUT, never a conclusion — a row a reviewer can re-run in two seconds is the only kind
     worth writing. A claim with no evidence is a guess: drop the claim, or go get the evidence.
     Doctrine: the verify-before-claiming skill.

     Shape each box owes, gated by scripts/validate-rite-evidence.py once ticked:
       E.1  a repo-relative path AND the commit sha or date it was read at
       E.2  at least one `command` -> a fragment of its output
       E.3  names the gap, or states explicitly that there is none
       E.4  lists a follow-up, or states explicitly that there is none
     The gate cannot tell a real output from an invented one — that is still the reviewer's job. -->

- [ ] E.1 Every local path this change relies on was OPENED and read, not recalled — recorded with
      the commit or timestamp it was read at
- [ ] E.2 Every external tool, CLI flag, config key, API name or version this change asserts was
      probed against the installed version; the command and a fragment of its output are recorded
- [ ] E.3 Anything that could NOT be probed is written down as an open question (design.md, or here
      when there is no design.md) — never stated as fact, never filled with a plausible substitute
- [ ] E.4 Scope check: this change does only what the proposal asked. Adjacent improvements noticed
      along the way are listed here as follow-ups, not performed

## 2. <!-- Task Group Name -->

- [ ] 2.1 <!-- Task description -->
- [ ] 2.2 <!-- Task description -->

## 3. Quality Gates (MANDATORY)

<!-- Adversarial review of the skills touched — not happy-path. Every skill added or edited
     by this change gets checked against the skills-authoring spec. Keep the group number
     as the second-to-last group. -->

- [ ] Q.1 Frontmatter uniform on every touched SKILL.md: name == directory, folded description,
      metadata.author solvelab, semver metadata.version, category in the controlled set, license MIT,
      compatibility present
- [ ] Q.2 All touched skill content in English (catalog locale)
- [ ] Q.3 Description triggers testable: phrases a user would actually say route to this skill and
      do NOT collide with a sibling skill's triggers; "Do NOT use for" boundary present where overlap exists
- [ ] Q.4 No duplicated doctrine: every cross-cutting rule restated inline was replaced by a link to
      its canonical skill (see design.md Canonical Home table)
- [ ] Q.5 Every code example in a touched skill uses English identifiers, routes, keys and event
      names; a term kept in another language carries its reason inline (`code-locale`).
      Provenance: maintainer field report 2026-08-14 (issue #76) — Portuguese identifiers and route
      paths shipped in target repos through this rite. Regression gate on the exemplar: the model
      imitates the code it is shown

## 4. Validation & Closure (MANDATORY)

<!-- Always the last group. "Done" is verifiable, not an opinion. -->

- [ ] V.1 `openspec validate <id> --strict` green
- [ ] V.2 Catalog discovery intact: `npx skills add <repo> --list` finds every skill, expected count,
      no orphan/renamed leftovers
- [ ] V.3 README / docs updated where the change alters catalog composition or usage
- [ ] V.4 `openspec archive <id> --yes` after all groups above are `[x]`
